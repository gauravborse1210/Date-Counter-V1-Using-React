# Date Counter Version 1

This component or we call it component will show current date.
It includes 'Step' and 'Count' buttons that let users navigate the date forward and backward.
The date changes additively based on the values of Step and Countâ€”if Step is 0 and Count is 1, the date changes by 1; if Step is greater than 0, the date changes by the sum of Step and Count.
